## Make hearts to your hearts content!

This is my second ever project finished in my process of learning Rust! (if you consider a [hello-world](/Wilker-uwu/rs-hello-world) a project at all).

### Installation:

After cloning the repo with git, simply build and have at it!

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Usage:

Throw a bunch of numbers and see hearts fly!

```bash
rs-heart-strings [HEARTS...]
```
...where HEARTS is just a number of hearts that you choose! Multiple numbers means multiple lines of hearts!

#### Example:

```bash
$ rs-heart-strings 5 32 16 54
